Swift.gitignore by Github Explained
What’s inside Swift.gitignore?

https://www.atlassian.com/git/
You put a .gitignore when you create a Xcode project because you don’t want unnecessary noise to be in your commit. But you don’t know what to put in your .gitignore so just grab Swift.gitignore from Github and go without really understanding what each line in the file means. I was doing the same but wanted to understand git in a Xcode and be confident of using git with a Xcode project.
